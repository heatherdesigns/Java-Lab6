<p>Home assignment: Objects &amp; Classes</p>
<p>For this assignment, you will be creating your own program using your own class as well as a driver program with the main method. Your class will contain common properties &amp; behaviors for the array of objects that you create in the driver program. Do not create classes used in the textbook or used during class demos. It goes without saying that you should not use examples found on the internet. The classes in this assignment should be of your own invention.</p>
<p>Create the following in your program:<br>
A class with the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>3-5 data fields – use appropriate access modifiers and data types</li>
    <li>2-3 constructors – 1 no-arg constructor and at least 1 overloaded constructor</li>
    <li>Getters and setters for all datafields (unless inappropriate, in which case, please explain why)</li>
    <li>1-3 methods to make some kind of calculation or manipulation of datafields – instance or static</li>
    <li>1-2 methods to display results – 1 must be an overloaded Object toString with Override annotation</li>
  </ul>
<p>A driver program with main method should have either “Demo” or “Driver” as part of the descriptive name and should contain the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an array of your class to be populated by objects of the class.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Populate at least 8 objects in the array using the overloaded constructor(s).</li>
        <li>Populate at least 2 objects in the array using the setters.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Display output by accessing the toString of the class.</li>
  </ul>
<p>Validating and formatting: validate as needed, such as not accepting negative numbers or numbers over a certain amount. Format doubles to 2 decimal places. Format dollar amounts using currency formatting.</p>
